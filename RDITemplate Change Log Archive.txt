'20141204 - JBD Removed old code\comments and fixed minor bug in keypad menu,
'20141204 - JBD wrote code so YSI Locations cant be zero and cause "variable out of bounds error".
'20141208 - TAV changed "Trans" variable to a String in order to revert back to "NAN" in case of incidental changes
'20141216 - TAV testing to get rid of "LocStg" and "YsiStg" because the new EXOs have a pressure sensor, should be no need for these anymore
'               May look at keeping them to keep standardized program that'll work with 6600 or EXO, but turn them off when not needed.
'20150107 - TAV added code to check on the amount of memory left on WH recorder at 00:15 each day. Needed to be aware as WH won't
'               resume deployment if there's a power surge, etc. and there's no memory left.
'20150108 - TAV added a StgRef that will populate in the SiteVisit datatable so we know what the reference (staff or wire weight) at time of visit
'20150114 - TAV,DEA,AAD added variables to allow for an indicator if someone had a visual reference on the stage. Created counter for reference
'           to see how long ago the most recent visual refence on stage
'20150128 - TAV fixed bug in the bad stage flags, added "VisRefOK" to SiteVisit table to more easily see when someone got a reference
'20150205 - MRS Added Code for Bi-Directional rating (different bins depending on flow direction) BI-RATINGS CAN ONLY BE USE WITH CHANNEL MASTERS SET IN INSTRUMENT COODINATES
'20150211 - TAV added "WQVisit", "DiveVisit", and "DaysSince..." counters measurements, WQ, and Dive Visits in order to display values on RTMC
'               to more easily see when service is due at each station.
'20150213 - TAV added "FullVisit" and date variables for WQ, StgRefs, and Dives to more easily see when maintenance was accomplished.
'20150219 - TAV added code to reset "HighMeas" and "LowMeas" to "False" if someone changes the high or low RatVels
'20150309 - TAV added code to automatically get pressure sensor and ADCP serial numbers as well as flags to indicate when a new instrument has been installed
'20150322 - MRS added code to decode the ADCP sn from the LongArray so wakeup and PS0 not needed
'20150406 - TAV added code to send specific flow data to a second datalogger (in this case Sac Waste Water). And send all data tables to a second datalogger in order to test satellite communications.
'20150513 - MRS added panel temperature to serial data out for SRWTP
'20150514 - MRS deleted serial code and added SDI-12 sensor code to output flow data to SRWTP slave data logger.
'20150921 - TAV Added SiteID to VelData Table. Added YSI data to 1min table, created trigger to turn on YSI data. Edited Stage processes. Now uses "StagePrime" to calculate discharge (as before), but instead of "StageSecnd"
'               there are "UpbeamStg", "VMPressStg", "PS1Stg, "PS2Stg", and "YsiStg" and the corresponding "TrueStg" and "Offset" for each. This will keep data in USGS database more organized.
'               Added VMUpbeam and VMTemp to Beamcheck data for Suspended Sediment Concentration studies
'20151013 - MRS Corrected YSI error bug where the sub bypassed the error even if ysi was not sending data.
'20151015 - MRS Beamcheck now recording every 15 mins the time (for sediment data)
'20151116 - MRS Added Code to restart EXO (via the CDMA relay) if ysi data is not present for an hour
'20151118 - TAV Lots of commenting to make program easier to understand. Deleted "StageSecnd" and Stage3" and associated variables. Left the subroutine (commented out)
'               for reference. Changed "OSVersion" to "OSVers". OS28 and higher have "OSVersion" as a constant, somewhere.
'20151203 - TAV Fixed a stage bug. Added "StageSecnd" back in for the sole purpose of getting the differences between stage values (to see if there's drift). Added a TempDiff variable for comparison of YSI and VM Temp.
'               Now the user will select the instrument used to calculate Q (with "SelStgUsed") and the instrument to compare to (with "SelStg2"). At most stations it should be PS1 and PS2. Still need to do some more clean up.
'               A couple edits to the WQ parameters made, added a second FDOM (one is FdomRFU, the other FdomQSU), YsiDO is now "YsiDOmgL". Fixed Keypad menu as well.
'20151228 - TAV Finished up some thorough cleanup. Dimmed a lot of Variables. MRS will dim others. Eliminated "Startup" datatable as it's never been used. Moved BaudRate and VemcoRTR into the scan so user can change on the fly
'               Deleted PowerSwitch as all boards (minus a few Args) have relays now. Deleted "SendSatData" as this was just for testing purposes. Fixed "TrueStage" bug, user shouldn't have issues with the values not "taking" anymore.
'20160128 - MRS Modified the lastgoodbin routine to correctly identify changes in correllation magnitude as well as RSSI.  If profile range exceedes endbin, it no longer gives lastgoodbin as zero.
'               Also changed CorrThreshold to 15 vs 8 to allow for latest program modifications.  Also make sure to set endbin to last valid velocity bin if not lastgoodbin
'20160201 - TAV Added "IsSubmersed" variable to account for situations when we may use a CampbellSci submersible enclosure. If IsSubmersed = True Then use SW12 port to power and cycle ADCP. (No CDMA present)
'20160425 - TAV added code to allow the PT3 command to be parsed out in order to return noise floor for RDI instruments. Had to increase the "Warning" string as well as "SerialIn" command to 2000 to allow for adequate space.
'20160426 - TAV added "NoiseFloor" datatable and a few parameters to the BeamCheck datatable. Noise floor table will be written ONLY with "PT3" command is issued. PT3 command will be automatically once a day per the user's choice, and can be done manually
'20160427 - JBD added Subroutine to obtain external battery voltage from sources larger than 12 volts (36-48 volts)
'20160505 - TAV made a "SiteVisit" record be written when the PT3 command is issued, added YsiWiperPos to know the position of the wiper of the sonde. Useful for WQ processing.
'20160509 - TAV adjusted data types in the QAQC Table for "rVel" and "rStg" from FP2 to IEEE4.
'20160607 - TAV changed all values pertaining to discharge in data tables FROM "Median" to "Average"
'20160627 - JBD added max\min pannel temp to QAQC datatable
'20160629 - TAV dimmed "SelStgUsed" variable so techs CANNOT change primary stage on the fly. They would need to send new program to do so.
'20160711 - TAV finished YsiWiperPos code to alarm techs when the central wiper is outside the housing. Still needs testing! (But won't affect measurements)
'20160721 - TAV Created ConstTable to allow use of this program on either CR1000 or CR6 datalogger. NEED TO CLEAN UP PROGRAM. LOTS OF UNUSED VARIABLES.
'20160823 - MRS\JBD modified the program (hopefully) to work with the VADCP
'20161011 - TAV fixed a couple comport bugs (labelling) for CR6s.
'20161020 - TAV fixed the WakeUpVM to work appropriately with VADCP (needs a "CSTOP" command in order to actually reset instrument". General cleanup, deleted a bunch of unused variables.
'20170403 - TAV added "CardOut" instruction to the SiteVisit table so we would have backups of SiteVisit files.
'20171001 - MRS Program re-designed to Use conditional and custom compile statements and to include Spike detector, EXO serial and EXO burst.
'20180320 - TAV Changed "SiteNum" variable to variable type "String *16" to accomodate short term stations that have long station numbers. Deleted "DiveVisit" stuff. Not really useful anymore.
'20180321 - TAV added a lot of timers around the subroutines for debugging purposes only. Stored every minute in table called "Debugger". Once we're comfortable, we can delete those timers and only keep a couple (ScanStart, ScanEnd, BeforeBurst, AfterBurst, etc.)
'20180323 - TAV Modified the "StoreAllToCard" subroutine to exit the routine if something malfunctioned with the card. Adjusted Data Table sizes to accomodate the "StoreAllToCard" file being written
'               To the card. Current card allocations are: DataOut, Burst, AQ, VelData, BeamCheck: 17280 records (180 days), QAQC and NoiseFloor: 180 records (180 days, unless user activates the NoiseFloor manually)
'               and the SiteVisit table to accomodate 50 records. This allows for ~1.94GB on a 2GB card to be available to the "StoreAllToCard" function.
'               Added ConditionalCompile statements around all WQ variables. If there is no sonde, there's no reason to have the variables populate in the Public table.
'               Created a couple Customize Constants values: "Debugging", "ShowAllVel", and "ShowRawWQ". Allows user to choose whether they want variables associated with those things to be Public or Dim.
'20180329 - MRS Fixed bug causing array out of bounds error if ADCP setup for more than 27 bins. Replaced hard coded 27 with maxbins constant
'20180402 - TAV Fixed bug causing Aquarius table not to write if the logger expected WQ data but the WQ sonde was dead. Added a variable "RecAQFlag". If WQDead AND within 15 sec of 15min mark then RecAQFlag = True
'               Otherwise, resort to normal operation of recording flag with WQ data
'20180405 - TAV Built more timers and counters to narrow down bug causing DataOut to be written every other day. Also reworked how tables are called. Now all data tables are called at the end of the scan, outside of any If...Then statements
'20180406 - TAV Made a user-selectable variable when using the AutoRange function. Now, a user can decide how many bins to cut off at the surface based on their beamchecks. *ONCE IT HAS BEEN RATED, THIS VALUE SHOULD NOT CHANGE!*
'20180509 - TAV Increased WQ "SerialIn" instruction's Max Characters to account for a full suite of sensors/more than 1 parameter per sensor. Set the "GetVariablesFlag" to True in the "Initialize" Sub. Otherwise
'               it wouldn't get called if the system went down and rebooted.
'20180622 - TAV Fixed bug that was disallowing modem to cycle properly. Syntax around Conditional Compile statements regarding SW12 ports was not correct.
'20180706 - TAV Added code to detect "No Sonde" being returned from the SOA. This will put logger into Redeploy mode until a sonde is found.
'20180710 - TAV Added the TrueStage values to the keypad menu.
'               Fixed another Conditional Compile Syntax error regarding the Modem
'               Added SVMaq Table to allow techs to get field visit readings easier without having to scroll through the public table. SVMaq table only stores 1 record.
'               Added IsNClosed to USR variables.
'               Updated BiRating code to allow for use with 3-beam systems that aren't uplookers.
'20180823 - MRS Fixed bug for warning if U ports are used for VM or Sonde on the CR6 using the comms mode 0 option. Put Serialopen commands in subroutines.
'20180824 - MRS Eliminated "baudratehi" and VMbaud is now set in constant menu
'20181018 - TAV added battery voltages (Station, VM, and Wq Sonde) to Aquarius data tables. Added individual sensor stage values to AQ table and removed "StagePrime" and "StageSec". This selection will be done within Aquarius
'               so the changes can be tracked and managed more easily.
'20181114 - MRI created MaxBurstCnt constant, added into constant table so it can be changed more easily. Call burst table when MaxBurstCnt is met and write to Aqurius table.
'20181206 - TAV added Bi-directional rating variables into QAQC Table.
'20181219 - MRI added stagesecnd and selstgsecnd to 1min data table
'20190220 - TAV & MRI reworked entire WQ burst function/loop. It had been reporting 15min late and also not being triggered if the sonde missed the prior 1min punch.
'               Wrote logic to Exit the For...Next... loop if burst values were missed during the burst collection. Still working on logic to COUNT the actual number of values used for the burst. Unless something
'                      happens in the middle of the burst, it's been verified that 30 values are used.
'               Wrote table to sample every value every time through the Burst loop so we have a table stored with each individual sample to verify accuracy of the burst table.
'               Added StdDev, Min, and Max to Burst Table.
'               Now pull median values from the burst table using "MedTempC = Burst.BurstTempC_Med" to populate the AQ table. No sense in having two tables process the exact same functions.
'               Because of how the Median function works, we now "Round" the time of the mid point of the burst. Median is calculated by averaging the two median numbers if the total number of values is even.
'20190227 - MRI added logic to dermine what comms mode to us for the sonde based on if a Max232 was used or not. Current logic requires use of the C ports but additional flag of WQUseUPort may be added if testing shows U ports can be used for sonde communication
'                Due to differences in processing speed the CR1000 was set to use a longer period between samples while collecting burst data to avoid missing/shifting data
'           TAV updated the burst loop to exclude zeroes from the median calculation in the Burst table if there were issues with the communication. Total number of values used in the calculation also seems to be working correctly now.
'20190320 - MRI Added statement to conditional compile out the ADCPLoop if the HasVM is false to avoid potential timing problems
'20190325 - MRI Added BurstPeriod variable in public table so user can adjust the period length that is sent to the sonde during serial burst communication. Had it set to standard 1150 unless otherwise declared. Minimum value is 250. Presereve in USR file too.
'20190401 - TAV Added logic to record Turbidity NTUs (in addition to FNU) if it's a DWR sonde. Also added logic to set the time in PST if instead of UTC if it's a DWR sonde. They are using KOR 2, which makes the time output in local time (PST)
'20190408 - TAV Removed NTU logic per discussions and findings about how the YSI EXO reports the values. Reading is actually FNU. The only thing that changes is the 3 letter acronym, so it is inaccurate to report "NTU".
'20190409 - TAV Made the "Wq_Mark_Bad" function only occur if its a USGS sonde, not a DWR sonde in Sample and Hold mode.
'20190509 - TAV Added CR6-RF451 radio link checking logic and reset if link is broken with up 4 total nodes in the system.
'20190510 - TAV Added base code to accept a daisy-chained EXO system (2 Sondes total).
'20190522 - MRI Altered communication with SOA to address sondes independently and accept commands for the targeted sonde only and send data to the correct field. Flags for redeploy and cycleWQpower work if either sonde is having problems
'20190529 - TAV Added Suna Code to program
'20190610 - MRI Added "OneMinConsistent" variable to allow 1min data to be recorded for a long period of time
'20190625 - TAV Adjusted timing of burst and suna samples, adjusted MOD functions and moved them to the top of the scan. Lessened delays between EXO redeploy routines to ensure we don't skip scans if the exo dies.

BEGINNING OF NUMBERED VERSIONING ---------------------------------------------------

'20190703 - MRI 4.00 Implemented easier to track program versioning with variable "ProgramVersion". Starting at 4.0. Adjustment of the version number should reflect severity of the changes made.
'20190705 - TAV 4.10 Added V1, V2, V3, V4 to DataOut table.
'20190709 - TAV 4.11 Increased buffer for SUNA port when it's opened to record data. Eliminated delay between opening the SerialIn command. Adjusted when the Suna gets turned off if it was manually turned on.
'20190710 - TAV 4.12 Added Program info to SVMaq table for easy access in case it's needed before midnight when QAQC gets written.
'20190711 - TAV 4.13 Put "MaxBins" in the Customize Constants section to more easily establish how many bins are wanted at the site.
'           TAV 4.20 Fixed some problems with conditional compiling if WqSonde = "NONE". Still some more work to do with other Customize Constant options.
'20190712 - MRI 4.21 Adjusted BinSpikes to pull from MaxBins variable to stop error when more than 27 bins are being collected. Fixed bug with top bottom sonde where the btm error flags would not reset after a power cycle.
'20190809 - MRI 4.22 Added FlowSign to the USR drive to prevent issue of incorrect flow sign being entered in the program, user reset in the field to be correct with the public table, and then a power cycle resets sign to original, incorrect value. 20190819-altered beamcheck table to be MaxBins*4 instead of just 108 incase we use more than 27 bins.
'20190903 - MRI 4.23 Added additional timers for ADVM process to help with further troubleshooting. Altered position of some timers out of If statements because if conditions were not met the timers would remain at the last value and not reset for each scan. This gave the appearance of processes happening "back in time"
'20191018 - MRI 4.24 Altered timing for the delay prior to taking the WQ serial burst sample to avoid skipped scans in a CR1000 due to its slower processing speed.
'20191022 - TAV 4.25 Altered SerialIn TimeOut for the SUNA to account for longer integration periods and potentially timing out before the next value comes in from the sensor. Also open the SunaPort before the scan so it's immediately dedicated as a ComPort (for emulator purposes).
'20191025 - MRI 4.30 Added backup iridium radio transmission capability for important sites. Done by turning the DCP into a SDI-12 sensor and taking Aquarius table data
'20191029 - TAV 4.40 Overhauled SUNA sampling to allow for stats to be calculated with less than 30 values as well as record good and bad data in separate tables.
'20191101 - MRI 4.41 In the scan moved the decodes section right after we take in the velocity data. After all ADVM routines are finished then continue on. This will allow decodes to occur while we wait for the burst to begin for a CR6. Hopefully this solves the timing issue. For CR1000s made it so there was no delay before doing the burst to help avoid skipped scans. Altered debugger table so all time follow the program order correctly.
'20191217 - MRI 4.42 Added ability to have a redundant sonde with all the same functions but completely seperate of a single sonde. This version works with Serial only. Serial burst will be supported if and when it is needed. Added manual power cycle relay option for iridium radio
'20200108 - TAV 4.43 Added code to turn real-time GNSS unit on and off.
'20200130 - TAV 4.50 Reworked Suna code a bit to store both dark and light frames or NANs if there was an issue during the sampling period.
'20200204 - TAV 4.51 Increased time GNSS unit is on from 12hr to 13hr to guarantee full 12 hours of collection before pushing to FTP.
'20200512 - TAV 4.52 Added manual switch to turn on SUNA wiper controller for calibration purposes. Reverts to program control when ready for sampling.
'20200513 - TAV 4.53 Tweaked manual switch for Suna wiper to prevent it from being on during sample window and added a redundancy to set to false in case user set to true after initial logic was passed.
'20200518 - TAV 4.60 Added logic to Suna code to exit loop and provide warning if symptoms of lamp failure occur: "Warning" found in string or "-1" found < 40 bytes into LightFrame string.
'20200713 - TAV 4.61 Added parsing of A350 for SUNA data and code for another error message. Changed from "Average" to "Median" stat for A254 and A350 per Alex Etheridge's request.
